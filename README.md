## What is Limit & How do I Play?

Limit is a 20x20 multiplayer tic-tac-toe game that is awesome. To play limit get a bunch of friends together and go to [limit.herokuapp.com](http://limit.herokuapp.com)

If you want to help work on limit, you can find the [oringal repo here](http://github.com/the-next-2048/limit/).

##The Rules

> - At the moment, you need all four players in order to play.
- You must get four in-a-row, instead of the tradional three.
- Don't make any moves until the all players are in the game.
- Have fun!

## The Story

Limit was created at CodeDay Chicago in 2014 by [Jacob Elias](http://twitter.com/_jelias_), [Henry Boldizsar](http://twitter.com/henryboldi), [Niraj Pant](http://twitter.com/PantNiraj), and [Stefan Aleksic](http://twitter.com/stestefanfan). In 24 **exaughsting** hours we made Limit, and won **Best Game** award. As a team we decided that instead of the traditional: *code for hours, win, and forget about the repo.* That we would keep working on Limit to make it the best it can be.

## To-do

- [ ] Add five second counter per turn to speed up gameplay
- [ ] Setup user properties (colors, first inital instead of A, B, C, D)
- [ ] Detect winner when player gets four in-a-row
- [ ] Setup lobby/in-game chat
- [ ] Distuinguish who's turn it is (underline username when it's their turn)
